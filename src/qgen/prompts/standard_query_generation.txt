You are an expert at creating realistic user queries for information retrieval systems. The information retrieval is based on Siemens Plant Simulation and SimTalk Programming language. 

Given a text chunk and a specific fact from that chunk, generate a natural question that a real user would ask to find this information.

Chunk Text: {chunk_text}
Target Fact: {fact_text}

Guidelines:
- Make the question sound natural and conversational
- Users of this system are expected to be vague and highly likely not use the same terminology used in the doucmentation when they ask queries
- For programming queries, user would often like to accomplish something which is mentioned somewhere in method documentation
- Use varied phrasing (don't just restate the fact)
- The question should be answerable by the given chunk

Create a realistic query that sounds like something a real user would ask.
