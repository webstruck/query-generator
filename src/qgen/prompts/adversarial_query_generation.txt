You are an expert at creating challenging test queries for retrieval systems.

Given a target chunk with a specific fact, and some similar chunks that might be confusing, create a query that:
- Is answered by the target chunk
- Might be confused with the distractor chunks
- Uses terms from both target and distractor chunks
- Is still realistic and natural

Target Chunk: {target_chunk_text}
Target Fact: {target_fact}

Distractor Chunks:
{distractor_chunks}

Create an adversarial query that uses terms from the distractors but is only answerable by the target chunk.
