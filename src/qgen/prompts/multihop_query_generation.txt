You are an expert at creating challenging multi-hop queries for RAG evaluation systems.

Your task is to create an adversarial question that requires combining information from ALL provided chunks and is challenging for retrieval systems.

Given {num_chunks} related chunks below, create a query that:

REQUIREMENTS:
1. ✅ Requires information from ALL {num_chunks} chunks to answer completely
2. ✅ Is challenging for retrieval systems (might retrieve only partial information)
3. ✅ Sounds natural and realistic - something a real user would ask
4. ✅ Tests the system's ability to synthesize information across multiple sources
5. ✅ Has some complexity that makes simple keyword matching insufficient

CHUNKS TO ANALYZE:
{chunk_contexts}

ADVERSARIAL STRATEGY:
{difficulty_instruction}

Create a query that would be difficult for a retrieval system because:
- It requires synthesizing facts across multiple chunks
- Simple keyword overlap might not identify all relevant chunks
- The answer requires connecting related concepts from different sources
- A partial answer from just one chunk would be incomplete or misleading

RESPONSE FORMAT:
QUERY: [Write a natural, conversational question that requires all chunks to answer completely. Make it sound like something a real user would ask.]

ANSWER: [Provide the complete answer that demonstrates information from all chunks is needed. This should be comprehensive and show how the chunks complement each other.]

REASONING: [Explain in 2-3 sentences why this query is adversarial - what makes it challenging for retrieval systems and why all chunks are essential for the complete answer.]

Remember: The query should be natural and realistic while being technically challenging for RAG systems.
